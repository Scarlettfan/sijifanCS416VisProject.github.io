            The Delta Variant was first discovered in 2020 India. The Delta Variant is more contagious than the other virus strains. As of December 20, 2021, Omicron Variant has been detected in every U.S. state and territory and continues to be the dominant variant in the United States. This can potentially explain why the confirmed cases increased the most in January, 2021 and January 2020.

            <br>
            There is a noticeable trend from this data set. The confirmed cases were decreasing in the first half of the year in 2021 but were increasing in the second half of the year.  The reason can be explained by the Delta Variant explosion in mid 2021 across the states.
            According to the data from Johns Hopkins University Database, the number of confirmed cases hit a 15-month low in late June. However, due to the delta variant rapidly spreading across the U.S, it is about 43,700 new cases per day over the past week, which is up 65% over the previous seven days and nearly three times as high as the level two weeks ago. According to The New York Times, “By early May, Delta accounted for 1.3% of cases, and by early June, that figure had jumped to 9.5%. A few days ago[late June], the estimate reached 20.6%.”
