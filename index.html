            The Delta Variant was first discovered in 2020 India. The Delta Variant is more contagious than the other virus strains. As of December 20, 2021, Omicron Variant has been detected in every U.S. state and territory and continues to be the dominant variant in the United States. This can potentially explain why the confirmed cases increased the most in January, 2021 and January 2020.

            <br>There is a noticeable trend from this data set. The confirmed cases were decreasing in the first half of the year in 2021 but were increasing in the second half of the year.  The reason can be caused by the Delta Variant explosion in mid 2021 across the states. According to a study led by the University of Cincinnati, “rural counties had 2.4 times more infections per 100,000 people than urban areas between July 1 and Aug. 31, 2021, when the delta variant surged across the United States.”
